Hi! I'm Maya! I'm a 14-year-old aspiring musician. I can be an impulsive shopper and I lack knowledge about credit basics. I wants to buy my dream guitar on credit but don't understand how credit scores work. I hope you can help me learn more about them!|"Question 1
You see a store offering a credit card with 20% off your first purchase. What do you do?"|Apply for the card and use it immediately for the discount.|0|While the discount seems attractive, applying for too many credit cards can hurt your score. Use credit cards wisely to avoid long-term financial consequences.
||Ask your parents for advice before applying.|5|Consulting an adult can help you understand the terms and potential risks of opening a new credit account. It’s a cautious approach.
||Decide to wait until you’ve learned more about credit cards.|10|Great choice! Waiting allows you to research how credit cards work and how they impact your score before making a decision.
|"Question 2
Your credit card bill arrives, and you don’t have enough to pay it off completely. What do you do?"|Pay only the minimum amount due.|0|Paying the minimum avoids late fees but leads to interest charges, which can pile up over time. Your balance may grow despite your payments.
||Borrow money from a friend to pay the full amount.|5|While this avoids interest, it may strain your friendship. It's important to repay your friend promptly if you choose this option.
||Cut back on other expenses and pay as much as you can.|10|Prioritizing your credit card payment minimizes interest charges and protects your credit score. This demonstrates good financial discipline.
|"Question 3
Your credit card company offers to increase your credit limit. What do you do?
"|Accept the increase and spend more.|0|Be careful! Increasing your credit limit can lead to overspending, which may hurt your credit score if you can’t pay the balance.
||Accept the increase but continue using your card responsibly.|10|This is a good choice! A higher limit can improve your credit utilization rate, positively impacting your score if you don’t overspend.
||Decline the increase; it’s not necessary.|10|If you’re worried about overspending, declining the increase can help you stay on track financially.
|"Question 4
You’ve been pre-approved for a second credit card. What do you do?"|Sign up immediately to have more credit available.|0|Be cautious. Having multiple cards can hurt your credit score if not managed properly. Only open accounts you truly need.

||Decline the offer to focus on managing your first card responsibly.|10|Great choice for beginners! Focusing on one card helps you build good habits before taking on additional credit.
|"Question 5
You’re tempted to max out your credit card to buy concert tickets. What do you do?"|Go ahead; you’ll figure out payments later.|0|Maxing out your card hurts your credit utilization rate and score. It also leads to high interest if not paid quickly.
||Use your card for some of the cost and save up for the rest.|7|Balancing spending with saving prevents overextending your credit and minimizes interest charges.
||Skip the tickets and set a savings goal for future concerts.|10|A wise decision! Delayed gratification helps you avoid debt and financial stress.
|"Question 6
You receive a credit card offer promising “cash back on every purchase.” What do you do?
"|Sign up immediately and start earning rewards.|0|Rewards programs can be helpful but only if you pay your balance in full every month. Otherwise, interest charges outweigh rewards.
||Research and compare other credit cards before deciding.|10| Smart move! Comparing options ensures you choose a card with terms that match your spending habits and needs.
||Ignore the offer; you’re not ready for a credit card yet.|10|It's okay to wait if you're unsure. Using credit requires responsibility to avoid financial pitfalls.
|"Question 7
You forgot to pay your credit card bill by the due date. What do you do?"|Pay it immediately and call the credit card company to explain.|10|Good choice! Some companies may waive late fees if it’s your first time missing a payment

||Ignore the bill and hope it goes away.|0|Ignoring the bill will lead to more significant problems, including damage to your credit score and debt collection.
|"Question 8
You’re considering setting up automatic payments for your credit card. What do you do?
"|Set up automatic payments for the minimum amount.|0|While this avoids late fees, paying only the minimum can lead to long-term debt due to accumulating interest.
||Set up automatic payments for the full balance.|10|Excellent choice! This ensures you avoid interest charges and always pay on time.
||Decide against automatic payments; you prefer manual control.|5|While manual payments offer control, they require strict discipline to avoid missed deadlines.
|"Question 9
You’ve been using over half of your credit limit every month. What do you do?"|Continue as is; it hasn’t caused any issues so far.|0|High credit utilization negatively impacts your score. Aim to keep usage below 30% of your limit.
||Pay off your balance more frequently to lower your usage rate.|10|Great idea! Frequent payments help maintain a low utilization rate, improving your credit score.
||Request a credit limit increase to lower your utilization rate.|5|This can help, but only if you avoid increasing your spending. Use the higher limit responsibly.
|"Question 10
Your friend advises you to open a joint credit card account to boost your credit score. What do you do?"|Agree; it seems like a good idea.|0|Joint accounts can complicate relationships. If the other person mismanages the account, your score could suffer.
||Research the pros and cons of joint accounts before deciding.|10|Excellent choice! Understanding the risks and responsibilities ensures you make an informed decision.
||Decline and focus on building credit independently.|10|Smart move! Building your credit history on your own avoids complications from shared accounts.
|"Question 11
You see an ad for a credit card offering ""no annual fees"" and a ""free tech gadget"" with sign-up. What do you do?
"|Sign up for the card and get the gadget right away.|0|Signing up just for rewards or gadgets can lead to unnecessary credit inquiries and may not be the best choice. It's essential to evaluate the long-term costs of having a credit card before deciding.
||Think about your actual need for the card and research its benefits.|10|Smart move! Researching the benefits, fees, and interest rates before applying ensures you choose the right card for your needs without impulsive spending.
||Ignore the offer; you don’t need a credit card yet.|10|It’s okay to wait if you're not sure. Learning about credit cards and their terms first is a great way to avoid unnecessary debt in the future.
|"Question 12
You’ve made a large purchase on your new credit card, but now you’re not sure how to pay it off. What do you do?"|Pay the minimum payment even though it’s not the full balance.|2|Paying only the minimum will help avoid late fees but will lead to interest charges. This can cause your debt to grow over time and harm your credit score.
||Put extra money into paying off your balance to avoid interest.|10|Good decision! Paying off your balance in full will prevent interest charges and keep your credit utilization low, positively impacting your credit score.
||Ignore the payment and hope to deal with it later.|0|Ignoring your payment will damage your credit score, result in fees, and may even cause your debt to be sent to collections.
|"Question 13
You get a notification saying your credit card company has increased your credit limit. What do you do?"|Take the higher limit and spend more on gadgets.|0|Increasing your spending when you have a higher limit can hurt your credit score, especially if you’re using a large portion of your available credit.

||Decline the increase and keep your limit low to avoid overspending.|10|Declining the increase is a responsible choice if you’re worried about spending too much. Keeping a low limit helps control your spending and debt.
|"Question 14
You’ve been offered a 0% interest rate on a credit card for the first six months. What do you do?"|Use the card for a large purchase now and worry about it later.|0|While the 0% interest rate is appealing, waiting to make large purchases until you can pay off the balance will keep you from incurring interest charges after the promotional period ends.
||Make sure you have a plan to pay it off within the 0% period.|10|Excellent decision! Paying off the balance before the interest rate increases will help you avoid paying extra fees and keep your credit score healthy.
||Ignore the offer and stick to your current credit card.|10|It's okay to ignore offers if you feel you don’t need them. Sometimes it’s better to stick with a credit card you’re already comfortable with.
|"Question 15
You’ve maxed out your credit card buying tech gadgets. What do you do?
"|Pay the balance off slowly making only the minimum payments.|2|Paying the minimum means you’ll be charged interest on your balance and will take longer to pay off the debt, damaging your credit score over time.
||Try to pay off your balance as quickly as possible to reduce debt and interest.|10|Good choice! Paying down your balance quickly reduces interest charges and improves your credit score.
||Ignore the balance and focus on making more money to pay it later.|0| Ignoring your balance can lead to bigger financial issues, including late fees, interest, and credit score damage. It’s best to tackle the debt head-on.
